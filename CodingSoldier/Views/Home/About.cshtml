        I'm going to write a long and simple "About Me" :)<br/>
        I'm from Kerala, India. I'm married and have a beautiful baby girl. 
        I got my Bacherlor's degree in Engineering in the year 2009.
        I have an overall working experience of 9 years in the IT industry.
   </p>     
    <p>
        My first company was Verizon, where I got recruited in as part of the college campus placement. 
        Since then I have been working in IT. 3 years in Verizon, 4 years in SolarWinds and currently working in Logitech since the last 2 years.
        I have been predominantly working in Microsoft Technology Stack. I would say I have been part of the DotNet evolution. I have worked from DotNet Framework 1.1 in
        VS 2003 to DotNet Core 2.0 in VS 2017. It feels like a long journey.
        I have also been working in JavaScript, specifically Node.js. Initially I was skeptical about JavaScript, but fell in love with it later.
        And I strongly feel the reason DotNet evolved the way it has, is because of the way JavaScript took over the market for its simplicity, 
        flexibility, dynamicity and performance.
        While working with Asp.Net core I tried it out in Linux. Being a 'Windows' guy mostly, working with Linux was really cool. 
        It helped me a lot while setting up Docker later.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm passionate towards technology. I learn new technologies pretty fast. The way I learned Node.js, Docker, Linux etc in a short span was such a feel good for me and I'm proud of it. 
        I believe basics are very important. I try to get my basics right before moving on to complex concepts.
        I have learned that the necessity of asking questions more than ever before. The 6 W's. They help in strong subject understanding. 
        I like troubleshooting issues, but at times it takes time. I take pride in the code I write. 
        I create utility tools that can simplify the work I do. Some of my works are available in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bnyjohns/" target="_blank">BitBucket</a>.

        They are many geeks out there whom I look upto for knowledge and inspiration. Some of those guys are so good, that they can explain very complex concepts in such 
        simple and elegant ways. They are so knowledgeable, yet so humble and I always follow/look upto them.
        Some of my favorite geeks are:

        Apart from coding and technology, my other passion is Sports. I put constant effort to stay healthy and fit. I do running, swimming and play badminton. 
        I do running once in few days and mostly on weeknds. Till date, I have run 5 half marathons and 1 full marathon.
        Of late, I have been doing some <a href="http://boneyjohns.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blogging</a> as well.
